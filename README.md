# ThemeDesigner

ThemeDesigner is a simple Python application that allows users to design and apply custom themes and visual styles on Windows. This application provides a graphical user interface for selecting background and foreground colors, and previewing the theme before applying it.

## Features

- Select custom background and foreground colors.
- Preview the theme before applying.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- Windows OS (for theme application functionality)

## Installation

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `ThemeDesigner.py` file.
3. Install any required dependencies if needed.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:

   ```bash
   python ThemeDesigner.py
   ```

2. Use the buttons to select your preferred background and foreground colors.
3. Click "Apply Theme" to apply the selected theme.

## Note

- The current implementation only serves as a GUI for selecting colors. The functionality to actually change the Windows theme is not implemented and serves as a placeholder for demonstration purposes.
- This application is designed for educational purposes and requires additional code to interact with Windows theme settings.
